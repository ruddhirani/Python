# 🔢 Even or Odd Checker - Task 1

## 📋 Description

This Python program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is **even** or **odd**.

It uses the modulo operator `%` to determine the remainder when the number is divided by 2:

- If the remainder is **0**, the number is **even**.
- If the remainder is **not 0**, the number is **odd**.

# ➕ Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50 - Task 2

## 📋 Description

This Python program calculates the **sum of all integers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop.

It initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and iteratively adds each number in the range from 1 to 50 to this variable. After the loop completes, it prints the final result.

### 🔁 Logic

- Start from `i = 1`
- Incrementally add each value of `i` up to 50
- Print the total sum
